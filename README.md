## Abstract
Postcards is a zero-clutter social media site that closes the generation gap. It connects users of vastly different ages through the use of age-proof online cards that family and friends can post and send to update loved ones on their whereabouts. Postcards allows users to request assistance from others within the group, helping families and friends support one another.

## Overview
Postcards seeks to connect the older and younger generations through an age-proof and clutter free social media platform. Users create a group and give a unique code to their friends or family to join the group. This group creates a private environment in which users may keep in touch with their friends and family in a meaningful way and create a support network between them. Users will send postcards to the group which contain messages and pictures. These cards may be scrolled through in chronological order and may be liked or commented on. We hope with this interaction to combat loneliness in the aging population, leading to longer happier lives.

## Technology Decisions
At the beginning of this project, we set out to create an iOS application using Swift. However, as we progressed through development, it became apparent this was a lofty goal because of our team's lack in time and resources. Because of this, we decided to switch to developing a Javascript web application. Not only did this decision take advantage of our team's more developed knowledge in Javascript, but it also made Postcards more accessible to our target audience and their loved ones.
