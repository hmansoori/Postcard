## Abstract
Postcards is a zero-clutter social media site that closes the generation gap. It connects users of vastly different ages through the use of age-proof online cards that family and friends can post and send to update loved ones on their whereabouts. Postcards allows users to request assistance from others within the group, helping families and friends support one another.

## Overview
Postcards seeks to connect the older and younger generations through an age-proof and clutter free social media platform. Users create a group and give a unique code to their friends or family to join the group. This group creates a private environment in which users may keep in touch with their friends and family in a meaningful way and create a support network between them. Users will send postcards to the group which contain messages and pictures. These cards may be scrolled through in chronological order and may be liked or commented on. We hope with this interaction to combat loneliness in the aging population, leading to longer happier lives.


## Technology Decisions
At the beginning of this project, we set out to create an iOS application using Swift. However, as we progressed through development, it became apparent this was a lofty goal because of our team's lack in time and resources. Because of this, we decided to switch to developing a Javascript web application. Not only did this decision take advantage of our team's more developed knowledge in Javascript, but it also made Postcards more accessible to our target audience and their loved ones.

## Judy - A User Story
Judy wishes she could stay in contact with her family on a more regular basis, but most social media platforms feel too public and impersonal to be meaningful. She mentions this to her grandson, who tells her of a useful website - Postcards! He tells her that it lets small groups privately share messages and media, without the complexity of most other websites and other social media platforms. Judy asked her family to sign up with her and start sharing within their own family group; this allows her to see what her family is up to and to talk to them on a more regular basis. Now that they can all easily communicate with Postcards, Judy feels closer to her family than ever before, helping her feel less alone at home.

## Statement of Impact
Postcards allows people of any age to create a private space to share with their family or friends. This support and communication network reduces the effects of loneliness in our aging population and helps our elderly loved ones live longer and more fulfilling lives.

## Maintenance and Support
We currently do not plan to maintain or provide support for Postcards. After the University of Washington Information School Capstone presentation on May 30, 2018, the Postcards team will cease development. Unfortunately, issues such as the lack of finances, time, and knowledge in fully secure data storage prohibit us from continuing on with this project.

## Knowledge Transfer
Postcards is a React web application that stores its users’ data on Firebase. Our team currently uses Firebase to handle authentication; store user media; and associate users with various user-created groups. Additionally, various libraries were used to achieve certain functionalities, most notably for styling and animations. These specific library names can be seen in our code and can be used through npm - a package manager for Javascript. In addition, since our code is stored on Github, it is open-source and easily accessible and available to all. Developers who choose to adopt this project will be able to comb through our thoroughly commented code and gain an understanding of our web application’s structure.
Our team's contact information is listed above. If any developers have further questions in the future or are in need of more assistance, they are free to contact us.

## User Documentation & User Guide
Postcards is a React web application that stores its users’ data on Firebase. Users can rest assured that their sensitive data - such as passwords - are securely stored and are not accessible in case of data breaches.

## Sundown Plan
Postcards allowed us to provide proof of concept for a clutter-free social media platform for users of any age to interact in a private and meaningful manner with their friends and families. We will not be continuing development of Postcards as our development team will be taking different paths after graduation.
